TASK
	Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message.

CODE

num = int(input("Choose A Number: "))
mod = num % 2
if mod > 0:
	print("You Selected An Odd Number")
else:
	print("You Selected An Even Number")


TASK
	Expanding the previous exercise, let’s say I give you a list saved in a variable:
	a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36,49, 64, 81, 100]. Write one line of Python that takes this
	list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.
CODE
	
a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]

b = []

for i in a:
	if i % 2 == 0:
		b.append(i)
print(b)	
	
		
TASK
	Create a function that takes a list of numbers. Return the largest number in the list.

CODE

ListA = [49, 62, 12, 13, 18, 99, 3, 5, 33, 35, 94, 26, 21, 31, 81, 96, 3, 5, 33, 53]

print ("Largest number in the list: ", max(ListA))


TASK
	Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not. (A palindrome is a
	string that reads the same forwards and backwards.)
	
CODE

string = str(input("Enter a word: "))

if(string == string[::-1]):
      print("The word is a palindrome")
else:
      print("The word is not a palindrome")



TASK
	Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonnaci numbers to generate and then generates them.

CODE

terms = int(input("How many terms? "))
n1 = 0
n2 = 1
count = 0

if terms <= 0:
   print("Please enter a positive integer")
elif terms == 1:
   print("Fibonacci sequence upto",terms,":")
   print(n1)
else:
   print("Fibonacci sequence upto",terms,":")
   while count < terms:
       print(n1,end=' , ')
       nth = n1 + n2
       n1 = n2
       n2 = nth
       count += 1



TASK
	Write a program that takes a number and print its square.

CODE

num = int(input("Enter a number to sqaure: "))
print (num**2)
	
TASK
	Given an list of positive integers with higher than 0 the answer should contain average values.


CODE


TASK
	Return the number of vowels per string.

CODE

string = str(input("Enter string: "))
vowels=0
for i in string:
      if(i=='a' or i=='e' or i=='i' or i=='o' or i=='u' or i=='A' or i=='E' or i=='I' or i=='O' or i=='U'):
            vowels=vowels+1
print("Number of vowels:", vowels)



TASK
	Write a program to convert degrees of Fahrenheit to Celsius.


CODE
	
Fahrenheit = int(input("Enter a temperature in Fahrenheit: "))

Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) * 5.0/9.0

print ("Temperature:", Fahrenheit, "F = ", Celsius, " C")
